// Enter initial amount: 3000
// Enter number of years: 10
// Enter interest rate (percent per year): 5.5
// At the end of 10 years, you will have 5124.43 dollars.

// At the end of the first year you have 3000 + (3000 * 0.055), which is 3165. At the end of
// the second year you have 3165 + (3165 * 0.055), which is 3339.08. Do this as many
// times as there are years. A for loop makes the calculation easy.
