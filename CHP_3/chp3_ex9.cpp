// many ways can four of the six guests arrange themselves at the table? Any of the six
// guests can sit in the first chair. Any of the remaining five can sit in the second chair. Any
// of the remaining four can sit in the third chair, and any of the remaining three can sit in
// the fourth chair. (The last two will have to stand.) So the number of possible arrangements of six guests in four chairs is 6*5*4*3, which is 360. Write a program that calculates the number of possible arrangements for any number of guests and any number of
// chairs. (Assume there will never be fewer guests than chairs.) Don’t let this get too complicated. A simple for loop should do it.
