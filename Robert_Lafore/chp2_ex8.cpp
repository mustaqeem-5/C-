// When a value is smaller than a field specified with setw(), the unused locations are, by
// default, filled in with spaces. The manipulator setfill() takes a single character as an
// argument and causes this character to be substituted for spaces in the empty parts of a
// field. Rewrite the WIDTH program so that the characters on each line between the location
// name and the population number are filled in with periods instead of spaces, as in
// Portcity.....2425785
